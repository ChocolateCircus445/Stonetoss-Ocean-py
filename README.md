# Stonetoss-Ocean-py
[WIP] A port of Stonetoss Ocean for Python

**Make sure Python 3 and PIP are installed before running**

This requires **PIL**, **requests**, and **pyperclip**. These can be installed by typing the following in your command prompt:

(Note that <current directory> is the directory of the project and can be obtained by dragging the "src" folder into the command prompt).

### Windows:

```
pip install PIL -t <current directory>
pip install requests -t <current directory>
pip install pyperclip -t <current directory>
```

### Mac:

```
pip3 install PIL -t <current directory>
pip3 install requests -t <current directory>
pip3 install pyperclip -t <current directory>
```

## Running the file

### Windows:

```
cd <current directory>
py stogui.py
```

### Mac:


```
cd <current directory>
python3 stogui.py
```
